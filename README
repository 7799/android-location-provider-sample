This is a sample application that uses Android location providers. It listens for location updates from the GPS and/or network location provider and displays the updates as they come in. Besides the basics, it also illustrates:

- Checking whether location providers have been disabled
- Getting the cached location
- Setting the minimum distance and time parameters for location providers
- Adding a spinner to the title bar
- Saving/restoring ListView contents when the screen rotates
- Basic conversion of objects to/from a Parcel
